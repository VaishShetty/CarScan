# Object Segmentation using PixelLib

CarScan is a project which focus on segemnetation of object (basically car) in a real-time scenerio. This project uses Semantic Segmentation with help of PixelLib module. 

This project uses the pretrained model which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ayoolaolafenwa/PixelLib/releases/download/1.1/deeplabv3_xception_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels.h5)

## Packages Used
1. OpenCV
2. tensorflow
3. numpy
4. pillow
5. pixellib

## Running the code
1. Run MainCode.py and the final output image would be dumped into "Output images" directory. The "Input images" directory contains the input image for the program.
